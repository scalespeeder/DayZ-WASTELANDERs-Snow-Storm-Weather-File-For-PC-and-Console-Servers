Using these modded xml / json files and instructions could break the functioning of your DAYZ server, requiring a reinstall that would wipe
all player progress.

Using these modded files neccessitates increased regular restarts to prevent server crashing.

SOMETIMES WHEN USING EDITED WEATHER FILES, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO REVERT THE SERVER BACK TO NORMAL WEATHER WITHOUT A WIPE / REINSTALL!

It is suggested you thoroughly test your server after applying these files to ensure proper
functioning of your server.

I always recomend you validate your files at: https://www.xmlvalidation.com/ and https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/

Instructions:

To download all of the files from the Github, click on the green "Code" button then "download zip" and extract / unzip that file onto your local PC hard-drive.

PLEASE MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR EXISTING CFGWEATHER.XML BEFORE YOU UPLOAD THE NEW FILE!

Then simply upload cfgweather.xml to your appropriate mission folder, over-the top or in-the-place-of the old file on your Server. 

(I have included the vanilla file when you want to revert, it's called cfgweatherBAK )

Re-start your server for the changes to take effect.

BIG THANKS TO WASTELANDER FOR THE WEATHER FILE!!!

Thanks, Rob.
